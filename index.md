## Welcome to Night of the Blood Moon
Here for you is my first outing of Night of the Blood moon - The game that I hope to share with the world in due time. This is the beginning of my attempt to introduce it to the public. Hopefully you will all enjoy these demonstrations as much as I have making the game.

### The Game

Night of the blood moon has a simple story: During Blood Moons/Lunar Eclipses your nightmares break into your dreams and begin to tear them apart.
Simple, easy, and a reason to beat up cute creatures.

From here I'd like to introduce our nightmare. The Three Eyed Crow.
His wings act the main attack for the game, and it uses a plethora of weapons which are fueled by the destruction of the dreams.

A main mechanic of this game is your weapons ammo - which is harvested from killing dream creatures.
Dream creatures are often cute and fuzzy, but take many forms in many places. Such as Tuba's, and Octopus (they're my favorite).

Weapons currently included in the game are bombs, crossbows, and boomerangs. I pull a lot of reference from Zelda games, but add my own twists to make them more impact-ful, fun, and unique.

Here are a few quick gifs of the game, much of the art is currently unfinished. I am sole programmer and artist on Night of the Blood Moon.
*The numbers on the side are for testing purposes. Please ignore them  :)*

*Quick in-development select screen, and first level. Each level is randomly generated with it's own name.*

![Thunderstorm Level](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CarefulMistyLacewing-size_restricted.gif)
*My favorite level so far, quiet, dark, and thunderous! You'll need lightning quick reflexes to survive here.*

![Symphony Level](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LiveDizzyIndochinesetiger-size_restricted.gif)
*The symphony - lots of work to be done here still. Those beds are filler - and will be changed with a stage in time.*

![Water Level](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ObedientDearestBaleenwhale-size_restricted.gif)
*It wouldn't be a game with-out a water level. This one is a lot of fun, nimbleness is the name of the game.
Winning / Losing generates a random message. Feel free to add more to these! All of them so far are submissions from friends.*

My goal is to create a fun - but challenging experience for an affordable price. The game will have 9 levels minimum, along with a variety of weapons. Unlocking more weapons is my goal. Bosses will be more than health pools, I want them to introduce unique mechanics into the genre - which is something I'd like to see more of in the games industry.

An example of this would be the Boss of the Symphony. In this level the dream creatures take on various forms of instruments. Harps, Drums, and a Tuba with a blow-dart/flute.
If you awaken the conductor he will use the instruments to play a symphony, but if you manage to destroy the instruments first then the symphony will be unplayable, and the conductor is useless - easy kill. The symphony adds a large challenge to the match in way of projectiles, but is beatable with strategy. Of course, every map is randomly generated - so the challenge will vary.

NotBM's biggest downfall currently is sound design and music. I have 0 experience beyond my self teachings for both of these things. Any feedback on good places to start or look would be amazing. Thank you TIG!


Ohya! There is also a leveling system. Currently ugly as all hell, but the idea is a skill-tree which randomly generates rows of different abilities. Health, Attack, Ranged, ect. You can buy an upgrade if you've obtained a connecting one. It isn't too deep, but it does add one extra sense of strategy to each run.

*One of my favorite abilities is the 'Marty-bomb' where on death the nightmare, Marty, takes over; getting a kill will re-summon the Three Eyed Crow.*


**I'll leave it at that for now, any feedback would be appreciated. My heart is in this, and my goals are high. Hopefully I can share this experience with all of you!**
